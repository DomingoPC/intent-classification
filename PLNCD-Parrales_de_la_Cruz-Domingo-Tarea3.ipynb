    "En esta tarea se debe implementar una serie de algoritmos para llevar a cabo una tarea de clasificación de intents.\n",
    "\n",
    "La tarea de intent classification consiste en identificar la intención o el propósito asociado a un texto o una consulta dada. Por lo general, se aplica en sistemas de procesamiento de lenguaje natural (NLP) y en aplicaciones de procesamiento de texto, como asistentes virtuales, sistemas de atención al cliente y motores de búsqueda, entre otros.\n",
    "\n",
    "El objetivo principal de la clasificación de intenciones es entender lo que un usuario intenta hacer o expresar a partir de su entrada de texto. Por ejemplo, en un sistema de asistente virtual, si un usuario escribe \"¿Va a llover hoy?\", la tarea de clasificación de intenciones podría identificar la intención del usuario como \"Consultar tiempo\". Esta información puede utilizarse para dirigir al usuario al servicio adecuado o proporcionar la respuesta correcta."

    "Para realizar la tarea, vamos a utilizar un dataset que ya ha sido preparado, y que contiene 150 intents.\n",
    "\n",
    "El fichero de entrenamiento asociado a esta tarea se denomina:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Dataset-Intent-Train.csv\"\n",
    "\n",
    "y contiene un listado de frases, cada una de las cuales está asociada con su intención correspondiente.\n",
    "\n",
    "Por ejemplo:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "new_card,\"is there a list of good credit cards i can choose from to apply for\"\n",
    "new_card,\"how can i find a new credit card to apply to\"\n",
    "lost_luggage,\"who do i contact for lost luggage\"\n",
    "lost_luggage,\"where is my luggage\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Como se puede observar, cada entrada comienza con el descriptor del intent, y a continuación, separado por una coma, aparece el texto de la frase correspondiente.\n",
    "\n",
    "Además de las intenciones básicas (correspondientes a operaciones concretas como pedir una nueva tarjeta o preguntar por el equipaje perdido en un viaje), el problema de la clasificación de intenciones tiene el reto de las frases fuera del dominio. Es decir, si estamos trabajando en el dominio bancario, podemos tener intenciones tales como consultar el saldo, hacer una transferencia, etc., pero si alguien se confunde y usa el sistema para consultar el resultado de un partido de fútbol, muy probablemente el sistema se confunda y devuelva una intención del dominio bancario, pero que será incorrecto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Así que es importante tener en cuenta cómo responden los sistemas ante frases fuera de dominio (Out Of Scope - oos). Por eso en este dataset se incluyen un conjunto extenso de frases oos."

    "Esta tarea consistirá en crear una clase, siguiendo el patrón que se muestra de ejemplo a continuación.\n",
    "\n",
    "La clase permitirá en entrenamiento de un sistema de clasificación de intenciones, y la evaluación de un conjunto de tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "La clase permitirá varios algoritmos para trabajar. Como ejemplo se muestra un algoritmo totalmente inválido, que simplemente genera una intent al azar.\n",

    "Pero se debe seguir el patrón que se indica para resolver el ejercicio.\n",
    "\n",
    "En concreto, la clase debe permitir los siguientes métodos:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Constructor__: Simplemente crea un objeto de la clase IntentClassification \n",
    "* __getIdentification__: Devuelve los datos de identificación de la persona que ha realizado el ejercicio\n",
    "* __loadDataset__: carga un dataset. Se puede utilizar la implementación adjunta ya que lo que se realiza es instanciar todos los intents detectados en el dataset y asocia con cada intent sus frases de ejemplo asociadas\n",
    "* __getIntents__: devuelve la lista de todas las intents cargadas en un momento determinado\n",
    "* __trainIntentClassification__: Se deben implementar los algoritmos de entrenamiento correspondientes\n",
    "* __intentClassification__: Se deben implementar los algoritmos correspondientes de clasificación\n",
    "* __testClassification__: Recorre un fichero de evaluación y aplicando el método de clasificación (__intentClassification__) va construyendo el resultado. La implementación facilitada debería ser válida con carácter general.\n",
    "* __testSummary__: Devuelve los datos básicos de una evaluación: total de ejemplos evaluados, total de correctos y porcentaje general. Debería ser suficiente la implementación facilitada.\n",
    "* __printTestResults__: Imprime un informe exhaustivo indicando el total de ejemplos evaluados, correctos y porcentaje, para cada intent. Debería ser suficiente la implementación facilitada\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Como parte de la implementación ejemplo, se ha implementado un algoritmo RANDOM, que realmente no hace entrenamiento, y que para hacer la clasificación lo que hace es devolver una intención al azar de entre las disponibles.\n",
    "\n",
    "La primera fase de este trabajo consiste en implementar un algoritmo que aplique un modelo de clasificación utilizando la estrategia Naive Bayes (código __IntentClassification.BAYES__), y en segundo lugar un algoritmo basado en TfIdf (código __IntentClassification.TFIDF__)\n",
